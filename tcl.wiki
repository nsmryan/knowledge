== Binary File Configuration ==

set f [open fileName]
fconfigure $f -translation binary -encoding binary -eofchar {}

== Bash Script that is Also a TCL Script ==
Start the file with:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# The next line is executed by /bin/sh, but not tcl \
exec wish "$0" -- $*
```
followed by TCL code. This executes the script as a bash script, but this
script immediately invokes TCL (wish in this case). The trick seems to be
the '\' character, which bash must not use to merge lines, but TCL does.

This allows an executable bash script to open a GUI, for example. The concept
comes from cobra's 'window.tcl' file.
