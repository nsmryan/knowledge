= Cooking Notes =

== Umami ==

Umami is caused by glutamate, such as in monosodium glutamate. 

Disodium inosinate synergizes with glutamate. It is present in yeast
extract.

Parmigian cheese appears to have a lot of glutamate.


Carrots have some.


Kombu might be a good additive to replace tomatoes for umami flavor in soups.


== Meat ==

Resting meat allows water to thicken with protiens as they cool down.
Also allows muscle fibers to relax, retaining more water.


== Alcohol ==

Alcohol mixed into liquids can make them more aromatic. This is because the
alcohol mixes with the water, separating out water molecules and allowing them
to escape more easily.

== Spices ==

Toasting ground spices heats volatiles which evaporate and escape. Better to toast whole
spices, or to toast in fat. They are fat soluable and will get into the fat instead of
escaping.
