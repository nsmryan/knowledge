== Vim Script ==


=== Variable Arguments ===

Example
```vimscript
function Varg(name, ...)
    echom a:name
    echom a:0
    echom a:1
    echo a:000
endfunction
```
echom cannot print lists, so we use echo.


The a:name is a normal argument.
The a:0 is the number of variable arguments given.
The a:1 is the first argument.
The a:000 is the list of arguments.
The a:000[0] is the first argument of the vargs list.


Arguments cannot be modified. However, lists and dicts can have their 
contents modified. Use 'lockvar' to prevent modification of this type.

=== Echo Highlights ===

To highlight echos with a highlight group:
```vimscript
echohl HIGHLIGHT_GROUP
echo "message"
echohl None
```

See ":help highlight-groups" for available groups. WarningMsg for example.

=== Coercion ===

Vim will coerce strings to integers, never to floats.
Strings that start with a number will be converted to that
number. Strings that start with a character will be 0.

=== Strings ===

Normal " requires espacing special sequences.


Single quote ' is a literal, but to get a ' within a ', use ''.

=== Methods ===

Many functions can be called on objects as methods:
```vimscript
echo "foo bar"->split()
```

== Help ==

To get the function version of a name, not the command, use
```vimscript
help split()
```
to get the command use:
```vimscript
help :split
```
